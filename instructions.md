# Optimization Profiling

With more than 5 planets simulation loading times get too long. 
We need to preapre a profiling script to see where the bottlenecks are what's introducing the most latency or overhead
Write a profiling script that starts the backend and simulates loading a system with 10 planets, measuring the time taken for each step of the loading process.
